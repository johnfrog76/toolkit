.SYNOPSIS
    The state of a card, read from its text. The CLI's half of the one rule.
.DESCRIPTION
    There is no status field. A card's state is derived from what the file says,
    in this order, and the first that holds wins:

        a PR URL: line, or a **Review:** line     -> Code Review
        a commit bullet, or a **Started:** line   -> In Progress
        otherwise                                 -> Active

    (Done is a card in archive/, which is where the file IS, not what it says.)

    The rule exists once per half on purpose -- this file and
    agent/core/parsers.py -- and the two are held together by shared fixtures
    in Tests/fixtures/parsers/, asserted from both suites. Patterns and state
    names come from consts.json, read INSIDE the function, so a caller that
    dot-sources this file has no enclosing scope to depend on.

    It is a file of its own so that Status, Move and Tests/Test-Status.ps1 all
    reach the same function by dot-sourcing it; it used to live inside
    Get-PromptStatus.ps1 and the suite lifted it out with a regex.

}

function Get-PromptFileStatus {
    param([string]$Content)
    # PR URL: line is the state gate between In Progress and Code Review.
    # {cliPrefix}GetPRComments writes it whenever a PR exists -- the URL's presence is the
    # gate, not the presence of reviewer comments (it is written even with none).
    #
    # Patterns and state names from consts.json -- agent/core/parsers.py compiles
    # the same two strings. Read INSIDE the function rather than from a script
    # variable, because Tests/Test-Status.ps1 lifts this function out of the file
    # and runs it on its own: a dependency on enclosing scope would make the
    # suite green by exercising something the command does not do.
    # Two writers per lane: git's token, or a person's. A card with
    # no pull request enters Code Review on a `**Review:**` line ("look at this
    # thing"), and a card with nothing checked in enters In Progress on a
    # `**Started:**` line. Both are written by {cliPrefix}Move, or by hand -- the
    # rule does not care who wrote the line (docs/hub/cards.md).

    return $c.status.active
}

function Test-P20CardBillable {
    <#
      False when the card says `**Billable:** no` (stamps.billable); no line means
      billable, so no existing card needed migrating. The CLI's one reader of the
      stamp: Daily (agent/ado/Get-WeeklyBilling.ps1) and the standup
      (Get-P20StandupCards) both read through it. agent/core/parsers.py's
      card_billable is the same rule.
    #>
    param([AllowEmptyString()][AllowNull()][string]$Content)
    $stamp = [string](Get-P20Consts).stamps.billable
    return -not ([regex]::IsMatch("$Content", '(?mi)^' + [regex]::Escape($stamp) + '\s*no\b'))
